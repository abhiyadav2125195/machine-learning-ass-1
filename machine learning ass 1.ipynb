    "a) Artificial Intelligence (AI):\n",
    "Artificial Intelligence refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. It encompasses a wide range of techniques and approaches aimed at creating machines that can reason, learn, problem-solve, and understand natural language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: A virtual assistant like Apple's Siri or Amazon's Alexa is an example of artificial intelligence. These assistants can understand voice commands, answer questions, set reminders, and perform various tasks based on user interactions. They use AI techniques to process natural language, extract meaning from the input, and generate appropriate responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Machine Learning (ML):\n",
    "Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms and models that allow computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data. It involves training a model on a dataset and then using that model to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Email spam filters are a common example of machine learning. A spam filter learns from examples of both spam and non-spam emails. By analyzing the characteristics of these emails, it develops patterns and rules to distinguish between the two. As more emails are processed, the filter becomes better at classifying new emails as spam or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "c) Deep Learning:\n",
    "Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that specifically focuses on using neural networks with many layers (deep neural networks) to model and solve complex problems. Deep learning has been particularly successful in tasks involving large amounts of data, such as image and speech recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Image recognition using deep learning is a prominent application. Consider a deep learning model trained to identify objects in photographs. The model learns to recognize patterns and features in images by analyzing multiple layers of processing. For instance, when you show it pictures of cats and dogs, it will gradually learn to differentiate between the two by identifying subtle features in the images, like shapes of ears, noses, and fur textures."
